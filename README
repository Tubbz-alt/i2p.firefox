To build this, you will need the following software packages (all available in Debian) :

* make
* nsis
* dos2unix
* curl

Before you build, you should update the files "NoScript.url" and "HTTPSEverywhere.url" to point to the latest direct download links of the respective plugins.  If those have changed, it's a good idea to check those files back in to keep them as current as possible.

After that just type "make".  This will produce two files:

profile.tgz - the raw firefox profile.
install.exe - the windows installer.
